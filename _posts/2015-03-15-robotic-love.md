Made in collaboration with Gary P., Philip Cadoux, and Sid Chou at ITP Camp 2020.

How do you build a feeling?  
After heated Zooms, we defined the one thing that embodies all that we lost in 2020. Above all, we lost touch. That is why we created... a robotic arm that extends the hand of friendship to the passerby.

Technologies used: Raspberry Pi, servos, origami, MQTT, JavaScript, Python

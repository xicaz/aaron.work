A meditative, physical VR experience that lets you connect with yourself through guided sessions. Made as part of Oculus Launchpad 2020 in collaboration with Michael Bird.

Presence connects you to a tranquil, otherwordly environment through magical elements that are tightly controlled by VR controllers. It aims to act as both a gentle introduction to virrtual reality while also being expressive enough to light the imaginations of VR enthusiasts. It was made for the Oculus Quest and is currently pending submission to App Labs. 

Technologies used: Unreal Engine
